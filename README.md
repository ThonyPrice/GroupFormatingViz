## Description
This project is course work for DH2321 - Information visualization. It's a mini project where based on all students replies in a Google Spreadsheet a tool to form groups where to made. The major task was getting familiar with D3JS. Inspired by the bubble chart master Hans Rosling I decided on a similar approach bubbles represent students. By coloring and filtering one can brush the data to make groups with a diversety of skills and interests.

The project is currently viewable [https://thonyprice.github.io/](HERE)

*Fun fact: To anonomize students all names were exhanged to Harry Potter characters* :crystal_ball::sparkles::ghost:
